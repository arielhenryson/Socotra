##Philosophy
Socotra attempts to make your  code modular as much as possible, reusable and easy to change and scale. We use the same language in the server-side and in the client-side and we provide a way to use the generic code which you can use for both sides of your app. We give you a well-defined structure in order to easily extend your code base and to understand it. We use TypeScript to catch errors in compile time instead of in runtime to enable you to spend less time writing tests for your app. We do a variety of things under the hood  to automate the process of creating your app. We give you out of the box support for SEO and   UI creation.
